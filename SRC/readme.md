 This trail can be sandy during dry summer months and is best after rain, in the spring or fall. The area can
 be accessed from the end of Densmore's Lane, the end of Old Petty Harbour Road and from Huntingdale
 Drive. 
While it has no real technical features to speak of since being redesigned, it is a lot of fun to ride this 
glassy smooth and generally well-bermed trail. Brief passing showers are keeping it wet but the sun and wind 
are trying. Blast down Ridgeline all the way to Lake Imaging Road.
After a few bends in the trail you'll get through this section and then start hear the waterfalls in another 
giant valley that you'll ride above. Small tree down between bottom of trail and bridge crossing. Better yet, 
don't do it unless other people are pretty confident in your fitness. A super fun freeride trail starting with 
the Pinkbike drop, an impressive 12' by 12' drop followed non stop features with lots of speed and perfect 
flow. From Lake Imaging Road it is a steady but not steep climb to the high point just before the intersection 
with Hooker Creek Trail.
Sections have the tendency to get rutted out. From here the trail narrows and skirts a rocky hillside. Rocks 
for texture, obstacles for fun and some short fast downhils in this 2. Great trail, with amazing views, but 
may see a lot of traffic. There is some pedalling but no uphill sections".
